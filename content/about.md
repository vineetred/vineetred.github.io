I'm a mildly colourblind CS grad student at [Northeastern University](khoury.northeastern.edu/). I did my undergrad from [Ashoka University](https://ashoka.edu.in/), where I graduated with a major in CS and a minor in International Relations.

My current areas of research include NLP and GAN based transformers. I also find myself dabbling in PLDI occasionally.

The projects I am most proud of are 
* [flowy](https://github.com/vineetred/flowy)
* [malwareDetection](https://github.com/vineetred/malwareDetection)
* [OneVote](https://github.com/vineetred/oneVote)

My other projects are availble on my GitHub](https://github.com/vineetred/) profile.
